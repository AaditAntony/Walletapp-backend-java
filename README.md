# ðŸ’° Wallet App â€“ Money Management System

Project Overview
The Wallet App is a beginner-friendly Java Spring Boot project designed to help users manage their money efficiently. This project is ideal for learning and understanding the core concepts of Spring Boot, including REST APIs, JPA/Hibernate, service layers, repositories, and dependency injection.
The app allows users to:
Create a wallet account with an initial balance
Add money to their wallet
Spend money from the wallet
Check their current wallet balance
This project uses H2 in-memory database for easy testing and learning purposes, making it lightweight and simple to run without any external database setup.

# Features
User Management: Create new users and maintain their wallet balance.
Money Transactions: Add or spend money with simple API endpoints.
Balance Checking: Retrieve the current balance of any user.
Layered Architecture: Demonstrates proper separation of concerns with Controller â†’ Service â†’ Repository â†’ Database.

# Technologies Used
Java 21 â€“ Programming language
Spring Boot 3.5.7 â€“ Backend framework
Spring Web â€“ For building RESTful APIs
Spring Data JPA â€“ For database interactions
H2 Database â€“ In-memory database for testing
Maven â€“ Project management and build tool


# tormmrow going to do the database
for how to use the h2 database
then move to the entity
how to use the jpa repository

# LEARNING
currently learning the entity section in the data
in java
refering the spring booot section from the chat gpt

for storing the blueprint for the users with the database
has been completed and pushed the code

# done
